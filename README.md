## Extremely fast sudoku-solver (uses minimal recursive backtracking and a lot more human-like sudoku techniques)

  This is a relatively fast sudoku solver (Leet Code Certified- Faster than 90% of all Leet Code Sudoku-solver submissions)

  It implements the regular backtracking method (trial and error) while also implementing a whole lot of actual human-like techniques in solving.

  The various human techniques it uses makes the program super-fast by minimalizing backtracking recursions.

  Backtracking in this program uses at most two folds of recursion (most other sudoku solvers use about 30-50 folds of backtracking making it extremely slow)

  I tested with this program, a Sudoku puzzle designed to defeat an average backtracking algorithm (sPuzzle4), and it didn't backtrack even once!
